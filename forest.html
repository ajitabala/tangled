   <h3>You have run into a huge forest, and have no idea whoere you are. You start feeling scared, and are regretting your decision. You are also completely starving. Suddenly, you run into a strange creature-the front half of it is an eagle, and the back end is a horse. Should you kill and eat the animal, or try to befriend it?</h3>
