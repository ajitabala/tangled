   <h3>Since you are so hungry, you decide to kill and eat the strange animal. You take an axe out of your purse and chop the animal's head off in a single blow. Then, you chop the animal up, start a fire and roast the meat over it. It smells amazing, even though the meat is a strange green color. You take a bite of the meat and immediately start choking. You can't breathe! You start seizing up and die in less than a minute. No one will ever find your body. </h3>
