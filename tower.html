   <h3>You are an 18 year old girl named Rapunzel, and you have been stuck inside an isolated tower your whole life. Imprisoning you in the tower is your mother, who is extremely overprotective and doesn't allow you to leave. However, your mother has recently left the tower to get some supplies, and you are by yourself. You know that your mother won't be home for a while. Do you want to stay in the tower like she told you to, or do you want to leave? </h3>
